# SuMo
SuMo is a mutation testing tool for Solidity Smart Contracts. 

SuMo was designed to run mutation testing on Solidity projects in a NodeJS environment. It can run test using [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), [Brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie)  and [Forge](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry), hybrid test suites, and custom test scripts.

# Installation

To install sumo run ```npm install @morenabarboni/sumo```

# Configuration ‚öôÔ∏è
Before using SuMo you must specify your desired configuration in a [sumo-config.js](https://github.com/MorenaBarboni/SuMo-SOlidity-MUtator/blob/master/src/sumo-config.js) in the root directory of your project. The ```sumo-config.js``` is automatically generated when SuMo is installed.

Here's a simple example of ```sumo-config.js```:

```
module.exports = {  
      buildDir: "auto",                               //build directory of the SUT (auto detect)
      contractsDir: "auto",                           //contract directory of the SUT (auto detect)
      testDir: "auto",                                //test directory of the SUT (auto detect)
      skipContracts: ["interfaces", "mock", "test"],  // Relative paths from contractsDir
      skipTests: [],                                  // Relative paths from testsDir
      mutation: {
         minimalOperators: false,     // Use minimal mutation operators
         randomSampling: false,       // Enable random sampling
         maxRandomMutants: 100       // Max number of randomly sampled mutants
      },
      testingFramework: "auto",                      //testing framework (auto detect)
      testingTimeOutInSec: 500                       //testing time-out for a mutant
}
```

### 1) SUT directories
 SuMo will try to automatically find your project directories based on standard naming conventions (e.g., /contracts and /test). These can be overriden in the ```sumo-config.js``` file. Contracts and test files/folders to be ignored by SuMo can be specified as well.

| Field | Description | Default Value |
| ------ | ------ |  :----: |
| ```contractsDir```| relative path to the directory of the contracts to be mutated | ```auto``` |
 | ```testDir```| relative path to the directory of the tests to be evaluated | ```auto``` | 
 | ```buildDir```| relative path to the directory of the compilation artifacts | ```auto``` |  
 | ```skipContracts```| blacklist of relative paths to contract files (or folders) | ```["interfaces", "mock", "test"]``` | 
| ```skipTests```| blacklist of relative paths to test files (or folders) | ```[]``` |

### 2) Testing Frameworks Configuration üîó

These fields allow to customize the testing frameworks used by SuMo.

By default, ```testingFramework``` is set to ```auto```: SuMo will automatically select the testing framework(s) to be used based on the configuration files (e.g., ```foundry.toml```) present in your workspace. If multiple configuration files are found, SuMo will try to run a hybrid testing process.

| Field | Description | Available Options | Default Value | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ |   :----: |
| ```testingFramework```| the testing framework to be used for compiling and testing the smart contracts | ```auto```, ```brownie```, ```forge```, ```hardhat```, ```custom```  | ```auto``` |

#### **Custom**

If you set ```testingFramework``` to ```custom```, SuMo will invoke the ```compile``` and ```test``` script defined in your ```package.json```. This allows you to customize both scripts and have more control over the testing process. For example, you can define the scripts as follows:
```
//package.json
 scripts: {
    compile: "hardhat compile",
    test "hardhat test --bail && forge test --fail-fast"
 }

//sumo-config.js
 project: {
    buildDir: "artifacts",
 }
```
Additionally, you must also explicitly define a ```buildDir``` (matching your compile command) in your sumo-config.js.

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations of Custom Test Scripts:
     * buildDir: must be explicitly specified it in the sumo-config.js
     * skipTests: will be ignored. You have to specify them in your custom script.
```

### 3) Mutation Testing Process Configuration
These fields allow you to further customize the mutation testing process:

| Field | Description | Default Value |
| ------ | ------ |  :----: |
| ```minimalOperators```| use minimal mutation rules | ```false``` |
| ```randomSampling```| use Random Mutant Sampling | ```false``` |    
| ```randomMutants```| the maximum number of mutants to be tested (only if ```randomSampling``` is enabled) | ```100``` |    
| ```testingTimeOutInSec```| seconds after which a mutant is marked as timed-out during testing | ```500``` |  

### 4) Using Coverage (for Hardhat users)
If you are using ```hardhat``` with ```solidity-coverage```:
* You can run ```hardhat coverage --matrix``` (See [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage/blob/master/docs/advanced.md)).
* This will generate a ```testMatrix.json``` file with coverage data for your project.
* SuMo will use this file to mark uncovered mutants as live and speed up mutation testing.

# CLI Usage

## Selecting the Mutation Operators
Before starting the mutation process you can choose which mutation operators to use:

| Command       | Description                        | Usage                    | Example                             |
|---------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `list`    | Shows the enabled mutation operators. | `npx/yarn sumo list` | `$ npx sumo list`  |
| `enable`    | Enables one or more mutation operators. If no operator IDs are specified, all of them are enabled. | `npx/yarn sumo enable [...ID]` | `$ npx sumo enable` <br> `$ npx sumo enable AOR BOR` |
| `disable`    | Disables one or more mutation operators. If no operator IDs are specified, all of them are disabled. | `npx/yarn sumo disable [...ID]` | `$ npx sumo disable` <br> `$ npx sumo disable FVR` |

## Viewing the available mutations

| Command       | Description                        | Usage                    | Example                             |
|---------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `lookup`    | Generates the mutations and creates reports without starting mutation testing. | `npx/yarn sumo lookup` | `$ npx sumo lookup` |
| `mutate`    | Generates the mutations and saves a copy of each `.sol` mutant to  to ./sumo/mutants. | `npx/yarn sumo mutate` | `$ npx sumo mutate` |

## Running Mutation Testing


| Command       | Description                        | Usage                    | Example                             |
|---------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `pretest`    | Runs the test suite on the original smart contracts to check if all tests pass and can be successfully evaluated. Pretest is automatically run when `sumo test` is executed. | `npx/yarn sumo pretest` | `$ npx sumo pretest` |
| `test`    | Starts the mutation testing process. You can also choose a single mutant / an interval of mutants to be tested by sepcifying ```<startHash>``` and (optionally) ```<endHash>```.| `npx/yarn sumo test <startHash> <endHash>` | `$ npx sumo test` <br> `$ npx sumo test mbc5e8f56 mbg5t86o6`|
| `restore`    | Restores the SUT files to a clean version. This should be executed if you suddenly interrupt the mutation process. Note that the restore command overwrites your codebase with the files stored in the ```sumo/baseline``` folder. If you need to restore the project files, make sure to do so before performing other operations as the baseline is automatically refreshed on subsequent preflight or test runs.| `$ npx/yarn sumo restore` | `$ npx sumo restore`|

## Viewing the results
SuMo automatically creates a ```sumo\results``` folder in the root directory of the project with the following reports: <br/>
* ```mutations.json```: List of mutations in json format, synchronoysly updated during testing. 
* ```index.html```: A simple web display of the results (you can view this using VSCode extensions like ```Live Server```). From here, you can also download a csv with the results.
* ```\mutants```: Folder with mutated ```.sol``` source files (only if generated with ```sumo mutate```)

## Minimal Mutation Rules
Some mutation operators foresee a **minimal** version:
* The **extended** operators generate a more comprehensive set of mutants. These guarantee a more in-depth test adequacy assessment, but they can generate more than one replacement per target (e.g., 
```+``` is mutated in both ```-``` and ```*```), which can lead to longer execution times.
* The **minimal** operators define simplified rules that only inject one replacement per target (e.g., ```+``` is mutated in ```-```), limiting the generation of subsumed mutants and speeding up the testing process.

By default, SuMo employs the **extended** operators. However, you can enable the minimal rules in the ```sumo-config.js``` file.
